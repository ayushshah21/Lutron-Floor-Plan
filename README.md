# Lutron-Floor-Plan

A Miro-like multi-user application where users can upload floor plans (ceiling plans) and annotate it with other users in real-time using stamps / icons (representing sensors, shades, light fixtures, etc). 

### **Team members:** 
- Ivan Zhang
- Zoe Sherman
- Ayush Shah
- Amelia Gankhuyag 

### **Tech Stack:** 
- Front-End: TypeScript, React.js, Vite, Redux, KonvaJS,  
- Back-End: NodeJS, Firebase, Firestore, NextJS, SocketIO
- Testing: Cypress, Jest

## Features
- [ ] The app must allow users to upload a new floorplan in the web app.
- [ ] The app must allow users to view a floorplan in the web app.
- [ ] The app must allow users to use drawing tools to annotate a floorplan with devices and controls to create a system layout.
- [ ] The app must allow for a multi-user experience wherein any updates made to the floorplan should instantly be visible on all usersâ€™ floorplans (i.e., the state of the floorplan is synchronized across all users currently looking at it).
- [ ] The app must allow users to export an annotated floorplan for use in other common non-Lutron design tools (e.g., CAD).
- [ ] The app must be unit & integration tested using modern web project best practices (e.g., Jest, Cypress, etc.)
- [ ] Nice to have: the app should be able to intake an existing Lutron floorplan.
