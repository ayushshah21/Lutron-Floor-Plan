A Miro-like multi-user application where users can upload floor plans (ceiling plans) and annotate it with other users in real-time using stamps / icons (representing sensors, shades, light fixtures, etc). 

### **Team members:** 
- Ivan Zhang
- Zoe Sherman
- Ayush Shah
- Amelia Gankhuyag

### **Lutron Sponsors:** 
- Hannah Fabian
- Wesley Breisch

### **Professor:**
- Professor Alan Jeffery

### **Tech Stack:** 
- Front-End: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Back-End: Firebase, Socket.IO, Express
- Testing: Cypress, Jest
- Libraries: Fabric.js, react-pdf

## Features
- [X] The app must allow users to upload a new floorplan in the web app.
- [X] The app must allow users to view a floorplan in the web app.
- [X] The app must allow users to use drawing tools to annotate a floorplan with devices and controls to create a system layout.
- [X] The app must allow for a multi-user experience wherein any updates made to the floorplan should instantly be visible on all usersâ€™ floorplans (i.e., the state of the floorplan is synchronized across all users currently looking at it).
- [X] The app must allow users to export an annotated floorplan for use in other common non-Lutron design tools (e.g., CAD).
- [X] The app must be unit & integration tested using modern web project best practices (e.g., Jest, Cypress, etc.)
- [X] Nice to have: the app should be able to intake an existing Lutron floorplan (Must be in PDF format)

## How to run application
- Run npm install to get dependencies
- Run npm run dev to start application

## How to run Cypress Tests
- Follow steps above with installing dependencies with npm i 
- Run npm run test:e2e:open to open Cypress test (this makes a Cypress pop up)
- Run npm run test:e2e:run to run Cypress test or run the tests manually in the pop up
- Make sure another instance of Lutron-floor-plan (localhost) is running with npm run dev in conjunction with Cypress running

## How to run Jest Tests
- Install Jest Runner extension on VSCode
- This will make run | debug options appear above Jest test, simplifying the process
